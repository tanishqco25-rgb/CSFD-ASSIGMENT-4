# Development Process

## 1. Project Setup
- Opened VS Code
- Created a new folder named "number_guessing_game"
- Created a Python file: number_guessing.py

## 2. Writing the Code
- Imported the `random` module
- Generated a secret random number
- Used a loop to receive user guesses
- Added input validation using try-except
- Added hints (Too High / Too Low)
- Added attempt counter

## 3. Testing in VS Code
- Ran the script using the Run button in VS Code
- Fixed errors in input handling
- Ensured the game loop runs until the correct guess

## 4. Initializing Git
- Opened terminal in VS Code
- Ran the following commands:
  - `git init`
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "Initial setup"`

## 5. Uploading to GitHub
- Created a new GitHub repository
- Linked local repo to GitHub using:
  - `git remote add origin <repo-url>`
  - `git push -u origin main`

## 6. Adding Documentation
- Created README.md
- Created docs/ folder
- Added overview, development_process, and future improvements

This process helped understand real-world development workflows.
