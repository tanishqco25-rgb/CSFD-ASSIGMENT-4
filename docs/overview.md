# Project Overview – Number Guessing Game

This mini project is a simple Python-based Number Guessing Game created using
Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub. The main goal of the project is to help the
user practice basic programming logic and understand the workflow of software 
development with version control.

The game randomly generates a number between 1 and 100. The user has to guess
the correct number, while the program gives hints such as “Too High” or “Too Low.”
The game also counts the number of attempts before the correct guess.

This project demonstrates:
- Basic Python programming
- Use of VS Code as an IDE
- Git commands for version control
- Hosting source code on GitHub
- Creating documentation for a software project
